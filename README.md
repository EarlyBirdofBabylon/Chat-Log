# Chat-Log
You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!
You both like roleplay.
You: Hey
Stranger: Hey! my name is Jessica, I'm 19 and I'm looking for a partner for a fun, sexual roleplay. I'm 175cm tall with wavy dark brown hair reaching down to my shoulders. I have a slim, fit body after years as an athletic swimmer, and my breasts are 34B. My eyes are blue-grey. Please introduce yourself!
You: I'm Grant
You: I'm 18, about 5'10", short black hair
You: Athletic build, some muscle, but not too muscular
Stranger: It's nice to meet you, Grant!
You: Nice to meet you too Jessica
You: Pretty name :)
Stranger: Thanks
You: What kind of roles are you into?
Stranger: Well, I have a few thought's but I'd rather get to that a little tater
Stranger: later*
You: Okay :)
Stranger: Instead, can you tell me about what you're into? Kinks, turn ons, etc.
You: I'm feeling kinda vanilla at the moment, but I am into sex that's on the rougher side
You: A little more dominant than sub
Stranger: Mm, alright, I very much agree
You: I'm into butts too, but who isn't? :P
Stranger: I lean on the submissive side of things, but not too much. I love sex both a bit rough and passionate, but also intimate and loving, so variation is great. I love cum, too
You: Sounds like we're both on the same wavelength then
You: YOu just into cum in general, or a cum in a specific place(s)?
Stranger: In general
Stranger: I'll happily receive it anywhere
You: And I'll happily give it anywhere
Stranger: And a more creative question... What's your favorite position, and why?
You: As played out and cliche as it is, I'd have to say doggy. I like it because it makes me feel primal, especially when things are on the rough side
You: Hair can be grabbed easily, the butt is right there, I just love doggy
Stranger: I agree, it's a lovely position. But my favorite is missionary... I love it because it's close and intimate, but in a moment can be turned rougher with you pulling my hands above my heads and pinning them there, maybe even lightly choking me
You: I'd be lying if I said I didn't like a good bit of missionary
Stranger: Hehe, okay
You: A hand around the throat isn't so bad either
Stranger: So, moving on to scenes then... Do you have any preferences when it comes to scenes? Any ideas or initial thoughts?
You: I'm normally into pretty cliche stuff. Classmates, best friends, b/s, etc.
You: I like scenes that go into the things I wished I could have done in high school basically
You: What about you?
You: If you've got any ideas, I'm open to anything
Stranger: Alright. I'm thinking it'd be really fun with a threesome scene, with two girls
You: Threesome definitely falls into the 'things I wished I did' category...
Stranger: Hehe, alright, ever done a third character roleplay before?
You: I have, yeah. But my experience is limited
You: Have you?
Stranger: Yea I have, the thought is simply that we both do lines for that character
Stranger: So, I'll give you the grand honor of designing her a bit... Tell me what you want her to look like?
You: I'm imagining her being fit, kinda like how you described yourself, small boobs, but a nice perky butt. Maybe a redhead, definitely some pale skin
Stranger: Redhead sounds lovely
Stranger: How tall should she be, how long should her hair be?
Stranger: You can use me as a reference, just tell her as compared to me
You: On the taller side, like you
You: Give or take a few inches
You: The hair hits just around her shoulder blades
Stranger: Alright
Stranger: I think Lucy is a lovely name, agree?
You: Sounds great
Stranger: Okay
Stranger: Getting to roles, then...
Stranger: I'd love it if we've never had sex with eachother before
You: I like that idea. How do we know each other?
Stranger: I'm thinking you and me are very close friends
Stranger: I can be a more free-spirited girl... Maybe we've kissed before?
You: I like that. Has there been a bit of sexual tension between us, or were we just messing around?
Stranger: I'm thinking there's alot of attraction, but not really tension
You: Okay, sounds good to me
You: How about Lucy? Are we good friends with her too, and have either of us had a history with her?
Stranger: Well, what do you think?
Stranger: I do think we should all be friends, but her eventual history, what do you think?
You: Since you're a bit of a free-spirit, I'm thinking maybe you two have messed around a bit
Stranger: And for us kissing, let's just say something soft and sweet... Like we were hanging out on valentines day since we were both single, and you had been fairly bummed out about it, so I gave you a soft and loving goodbye kiss when I left
Stranger: Hm, what have I and lucy done then?
You: I really like that idea
You: Hmm
You: I think you guys have definitely kissed before, and it was more than the soft and sweet kiss we've shared.
Stranger: mhm, alright, more detail?
You: Lucy mentioned to you that she had never been with a girl before, but she wished she had. Then, you started flirting with her a bit, and you gave her a kiss, to which she responded with deep kissing
You: And did you guys continue past that point? What do you think?
Stranger: Let's say some deep kissing, and not more than that
Stranger: I like the idea of you pushing us together a bit during the threesome
You: Alright, so you've told me about it
Stranger: Yea
Stranger: Who does the suggestion for a threesome?
Stranger: And I'm guessing Lucy is one of my closest friends, and we've melded together into a friend-trio?
You: Yeah, sounds about right
You: I don't think I'm doing the suggesting, because I assume you and Lucy are involved
You: Maybe Lucy?
Stranger: Hm, maybe... I had a thought that maybe the other guys tease you about being with girls all the time, and one of them jokingly and mockingly saying "I bet he fucks them both" to mock you... And when they've left I simply say "Actually... Why don't you?" Or something like that
Stranger: Me and Lucy both being equally willing and free-spirited about it
You: Ooh I like that
Stranger: Alright! Should we have it been set up that way?
You: I think it may not have been the outright intention for us to have a threesome, but you two definitely acknowledged it as a possibility
You: Which leads me into the setting. I'm imagining us going to a lake house or whatever for the weekend without any family
Stranger: Okay, finish telling me your idea, I just wanted to tell mine too and we can choose
You: Okay, I'll explain it more fully
Stranger: I imagine that since we are so close as friends, you've given me a key to your apartment since I'm pretty much always welcome. We're all three moved to a new town for school. So, in the evening after that afternoon, you come home to me having invited myself and Lucy in, and we're posing for you as a clear invitation
You: I really really like that idea
Stranger: Do you?
You: Yeah
You: I like it better than mine :)
Stranger: Okay^^ let's do that one then
Stranger: So, if you start with you coming home, I can go from there and more elaborately explain our posing?
You: Alright, sounds good. It'll take just a minute
Stranger: Go ahead, don't feel the pressure to write long or anything, whatever is long enough to get the message through
Stranger: (Oh, a little quick thing I wanted to put in... I'm bisexual, so don't worry about making me uncomfortable with girl on girl things, you won't)
You: The professor gets to the final slide of his presentation for the day just as I'm about to fall asleep from a mixture of boredom and fatigue from the week. I step out of the lecture hall into the cool fall air, which wakes me up a bit. My apartment is just a short walk away, so I make it to my door quickly. Opening the door slowly, I walk in, dropping my bag immediately and throwing my shoes off. I exhale deeply, whispering, "finally the weekend..." I walk down the hall, muttering to myself, "hm, I wonder what Jessica is doing tonight."
You: (Okay, great. You don't have to worry about making me uncomfortable with girl on girl things either :P)
Stranger: You pass by a piece of clothing on the ground... It's probably something left behind by me from one of the countless times I've slept over here but it still looks out of place... Your thought is both validated and put aside when you enter the bedroom as there, on the bed, you see me and Lucy. I'm sitting on my knees, with a white top and a blue skirt. The skirt is a fairly short one, yet it still manages to conceal what it has to even in this position. My white top is a nice, white blouse, almost out of a school uniform, yet it's a bit shorter. It curves in a lovely way around my chest, and then leaves my well toned and fit belly bare. Lucy has a similar top, but she instead has jeans short shorts. What more is common between us is our sly smile, and the condom, still in the pink wrapper, we each have held with our teeth.
Stranger: (Sorry, I won't write that long, just wanted to get the pose right)
Stranger: (Sorry, forgot one thing... Lucy is lying flat on her tummy, her head just on the edge of the bed)
You: I stand in the doorway, Lucy and Jessica on my bed, obviously up to no good. It takes me a minute to process what's going on, first looking at their positions on my bed, then the skimpy outfits, and the condom. For a brief second, I gawk at the scene laid out in front of me on my own bed. My face flushed, the black sweater I'm wearing is suddenly too warm. I stick my fingers in the neck, letting some cool air in as I meekly say, "hey, uh, you two look good..." I can only manage to let out a weak laugh because of my nervousness. Lucy giggles at me from her spot on my bed.
Stranger: "Surprise!" I say in a cheerful and affectionate voice. "Which one looks better?" I follow up cheerfully, and lucy immediately adds "Yea, who looks best?" I say as our eyes stick to yours, curiously inspecting and analyzing you. I arch my back forward a little bit, stretching my left arm straight up and my right one over my head holding it. After speaking I move the condom back centered, having had to move it to the side and hold it with my lip to speak.
You: "Kind of a loaded question, don't ya think?" I meekly ask. Lucy fires back, "you're right! You haven't answered our question though" Subconsciously, I mess with my hair, fixing my part and pushing my hair over off of my forehead. My eyes dart back and forth between the two beauties on my bed, condom in mouth and skin showing. "I really can't choose. You two both look so... sexy," I admit.
Stranger: I keep smiling. "Well, why don't you take a little picture then? For your own collection" I say softly, and Lucy continues. "But you have to pick one of us first... Just say who you think looks the best, you could say a few different categories if you want... We both promise not to be upset!" She exclaims and I nod in agreement.
You: My hand practically moves at the speed of light to grab my phone out of my pocket. "I hope just my phone camera is enough for you guys... I have my proper camera over there if you want," I say, hoping they'd ask for me to use my DSLR; it'd be nice to have pictures of my two close friends in such high quality. "I know you want some fancy pictures for future lonely nights, Grant, but you have to earn those by answering our damn question first!" Lucy teases playfully. My feet shuffle in place in an attempt to adjust my hard length in my pants. "Okay, fine. Jessica wins in the brunette category, and Lucy wins the redhead category!" I grin at them, thinking I'm clever.
Stranger: I get a sly smirk, rolling my eyes a little git as Lucy giggles. "Well... Who wins in pose?" I ask, Lucy following with "... And body..." and I finish with. "... And overall..." I say softly, looking at you. "I know you're bound to prefer us differently... Maybe I'll let you have more intimate pictures if you answer truthfully..."
You: I sigh, disappointed my trick didn't work on the girls. On the wall in front of my bed is a bench where I put on my shoes, I sit down on the bench, the two girls posed seductively on my bed directly across from me. I begin, "for pose, Jessica. Body is going to be Lucy... you can't beat that ass." Lucy smiles at my decision and says, "now here comes the toughest decision of them all. The tie breaker! Overall..." My head hits the wall softly with a thump as I lean back slowly to really think about my decision. I think about the time that me and Jessica kissed on Valentine's Day, and how I've wanted her so bad ever since. "In the overall category, I'm picking Jessica," I declare.
You: (Sorry if my responses are slow! I'm used to long form RP on Reddit rather than chat things like this)
Stranger: (Ah, alright. Well, I love the thorough replies, but I wouldn't mind them being a bit shorter and faster)
Stranger: I smile triumphantly first when you say I win in pose, and when you lastly declare me the overall winner my triumphant smile becomes even more cheerful, Lucy making a slightly grumpy one besides our promise. "Well, now comes the really important part..." I smile softly towards you, holding my condom in my hand. "Now, you have a picture, and a memory... We're letting you decide whether there should be an experience to remember there, too" I say and Lucy nods in agreement. I speak in a very soft and calming voice now. "Whatever you choose we'll be happy about it"
You: I can't help but smile at the offer, as I look at the condom. "An experience to remember would be nice..." I say softly. Standing up, I ask boldly, "do you think I could sit with you two to discuss the experience?" Lucy scoots over on the bed, creating just enough room in between her and Jessica to fit me. She didn't outright say yes or no, but I'm taking her moving as an invitation, so I sit down in between my two beautiful friends and say, "so, about that experience to remember..."
Stranger: I hop in closer to you when you come sit between us, removing the condom and holding it in my hand instead. "It's alright, we're all friends here right? No need to be shy or nervous around us" Lucy says, and I nod. "Yea, just say what you'd like from us... Whatever it might be"
You: I sit quietly for a second while I contemplate my response, not wanting to go too far and mess this up for myself. However, I remember that I'm sitting between my two scantily clad friends who have a condom in hand, and forget about worrying over going too far. I think Lucy and Jessica are willing to go far. "Well, my friends always tease me by saying that I am involved with you two... and I wouldn't mind using that condom and proving them right," I nervously admit. Quickly, I add, "I wouldn't mind proving them right without the condom either." Lucy laughs and says, "see? I knew you'd loosen up a bit."
Stranger: I lean towards you, giving a little kiss on your cheek. I lean in to your ear, whispering softly. "You're the most trusted and loved person I have in my life... I'd adore making love with you, and having that intimacy between us" I nibble your ear a little afterwards as a tease, and Lucy speaks up with a seductive "Well, can you be a little more specific about your wishes?"
You: Jessica's soft voice in my ear and her warmth radiating to my body is enough to bring me to a full erection underneath my jeans. I say, "Specific... okay, well, I would like to have sex with the two of you." I let out a short breath in relief after letting out the words. With every step Lucy and Jessica take me, I get less and less nervous. Lucy smiles and says, "sex with the two of us? I think we might be able to help with that a little. What should we start with?" I look at the two on either side of me in their white blouses and ask, "it's kind of hot in here, don't you think?"
Stranger: (I-I don't want to be a buzzkill... But it's incredibly late here and I have to go... Do you think we can try and meet up tomorrow to continue?)
You: (No worries. Sorry things were slow on my part. I'd love to continue tomorrow. How do you want to try and meet up?)
Stranger: (Well, we can set a time to meet and make a chatzy room to meet in... That's the best I have, honestly)
You: (Okay, that's cool with me. How does 9PM EST sound?)
Stranger: (Hm, what time do you have right now?)
You: (It's 11:05 EST here)
Stranger: (Okay... It's 5 am for me here)
You: (Oh wow. Do you have a time that would work best for you?)
Stranger: (yea... midnight in my time would be great)
Stranger: (When is that for you?)
You: (That's 6PM for me. I should be able to make it then.)
Stranger: (Alright. If something comes up just write it in the chatroom and I'll see it, and if you can be there earlier you can have it open in the background or so, I will if I can get there earlier)
Stranger: (there's the chat address for you, http://us23.chatzy.com/49548924947971 )
You: (Okay, I'll try to make it by 6. Might be half an hour to an hour late possibly. I have family in town and that's about dinner time for us.)
Stranger: (Can you maybe copy this chat in there, in case we forget something?)
You: (Yeah, sure)
Stranger: (Thank you^^ You've been absolutely lovely to be with, I actually never try to maintain contact in any way, but you were just too good to let go of<3)
You: (Thanks, you've been amazing as well. Hope to continue tomorrow Jessica. Glad we matched :))
Stranger: (I'm gonna go to bed now, alright? I'll see you tomorrow<3)
You: (Okay, goodnight)
Stranger: (night<3)
